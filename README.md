🅿️ Simple Smart Parking Management System

📘 Overview
The Simple Smart Parking Management System (SSPMS) is a Java-based console application that simulates a parking lot management process.  
It allows users to view, reserve, and pay for parking slots, and start or end parking sessions — all through a simple, text-based interface.  
Admins can view registered users, check slot statuses, and see all reservations.

This project was created for the **Principles of Software Engineering** course as a simplified version of a Smart Parking System.
